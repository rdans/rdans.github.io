**Automatic Lung's Grade Image Classification from CT**

## Preprocessing
This week, we finish the preprocessing image, which takes the whole week to do some trial and errors until the image is successfully generated. 

We are doing this preprocessing using jupyter notebook and a couple build-in library and packages, such as numpy, maplotplib, dicom, os, os.path, scipy.ndimage, and pandas.

For the whole CT scan images, the total size of the image is around 66 GB and to do the image preprocessing itself, requires a lot of time to finish it all. However, in term of testing we used a smaller dataset, which have a size around 1.8 GB.  Images below are the result of the preprocessing and lung segmentation. Code and algorithm will discuss below.

First, due to the amount of noise that generated by the radiation of CT scan, it is hard to determine the nodule or just a regular air. Thus, before we could use the data to train the model, we need to do some image processing technique, to remove redundancy across all images, since not all of the images in the whole dataset have the same format.


Below is the code for the pixel adjustment.

```python

```

Below is the code for the Watershed
```python

```
