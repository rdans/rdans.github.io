## Preprocessing
This week, we finish the preprocessing image, which takes the whole week to do some trial and errors until the image is successfully generated. 

We are doing this preprocessing using jupyter notebook and a couple build-in library and packages, such as numpy, maplotplib, dicom, os, os.path, scipy.ndimage, and pandas.

Some difficulties that we had in the preprocessing images are we do not actually have a lot of data to train since the file is super big. For the whole samples pictures, the total size of the image is 66 GB, which is half of the capacity of our laptop. However, we managed to get a subset or smaller dataset of the images.
